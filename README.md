# Guess My Number - Frontend Project

## Overview
This is the second project that I designed and wrote on my own, with this one I wanted to go with a very special and playful design, here 
I also included a lot of cool transition effects and smooth hovering. Guess My Number is simply a fun and interesting game. The game is about a player that has to guess the secret number to win the game within a certain amount of chances. You will have 20 guesses to randomly guess a number between 1-20, you win if you do it under 20 attempts but if not then you will lose, and the game will restart. This game includes a lot of JavaScript for making the functioning of the game work perfectly.
